## Resources: CI Tools
There are a lot of good options for tools out there. You can have a look at this article for a run down of all of them: https://code-maze.com/top-8-continuous-integration-tools/

As I stated in the video, most companies use one of these tools and my personal recommendations are:

TravisCI or CircleCI for hosted CI servers. 

Jenkins for your own managed CI servers.
